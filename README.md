# Model-Free-Reinforcement-Learning
Overview of policy gradients,  Actor Critic model, DDPG, SAC, PPO Reinforcement learning algorithms

In the notebook , we cover in depth analysis of some Model- free RL algorithms such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm, Soft actor critic algorithms on Mountain-Car Open-AI Gym environment and provide a comparative study of performance with respect to random actions. We have explained terminologies and mechanism of each of the algorithms encompassing intuition, necessity, advantages and probable disadvantages wherever possible.
